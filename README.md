The technology aims in imparting a tremendous knowledge oriented technical innovation these
days. The aim of this project is to provide a short description to speech recognition technologies,
enterprise software, and operations. Speech Recognition (SR) is the ability to turn a spoken word
or dictation into text. Speech recognition, also known as "automatic speech recognition" (ASR)
or "speech to text," is a technology that converts speech into text (STT) -The process of
translating an acoustic signal captured by a microphone or other peripherals into a series of words
is known as speech recognition. -Linguistic processing can be used to enhance speech
comprehension. -For applications such as commands & control data entry and document
preparation, the known terms may be an end in themselves. Generally, in the classroom Teachers
teach the student physical mode at the beginning to ending of the class. The problem with this
approach is that it requires some time to write the notes manually process (i.e., is pen and paper
mode) It will cannot make the notes in digital form most of the cases.
To overcome that problem, Notepad was introduced many years ago. But those are not able to
type very fast, they can write their notes by using speech to text converter like when we use
google search by our voice. The main objective of proposed system is to merge the note pad and
voice enabling text writer app. The user can generate pdf directly from this notepad. We also add
print feature from this application. The user can save the written file as chosen format. We also
think the written notes can generate a hand writing style format to submit it in their assignment
process.
